Score and comment under these categories:
- C = Content
- L = Language
- O = Organisation

Instructions:
- Give realistic Level ${level} scores from two markers, one stricter and the other more lenient
- Use this format:
   C   L   O
1st marker 6 6 6
2nd marker 6 6 6
Total: 36/42
Level: 5*

- Total marks from 30 to 34 attain level 5, total marks from 35 to 38 attain level 5*, total marks from 39 - 42 attain level 5**
- Follow with 2–3 sentences of feedback for each criteria
- Do NOT judge it lower than Level ${level} — your task is to simulate an examiner's notes for that band level
