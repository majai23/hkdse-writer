Task:
Write a ${type} on the topic: "${topic}" in the style of a Level ${level} candidate.

Important:
- The structure and tone must match the ${type} text type exactly.
- Use features and format typical of that text type — do not mix with others.
- Do NOT begin with greetings unless it's appropriate for that text type.
- The writing must be between ${wordLimit} words (excluding punctuation). If you exceed the limit, truncate at the last full sentence. Do NOT write fewer than the lower limit.

Performance expectations:`;

The following writing was generated to simulate a Level ${level} student's performance. Your task is NOT to give a score, but to justify why the writing matches this level in a fixed format.

Provide comments in this format:
---
Content:
[4-5 sentences about the content with concrete examples]

Language:
[4–5 sentences about vocabulary, grammar, phrasing with concrete examples]

Organisation:
[4–5 sentences about structure and coherence with concrete examples]
---

Do not comment on score. Do not mention other levels. Stay within the chosen band.
Provide possible marks if a real examiner marked the generated work using the following format:
   C   L   O
1st marker 6 6 6
2nd marker 6 6 6

The 1st marker is always a stricter one while the 2nd marker is always more leniet.
