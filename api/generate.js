- C = Content
- L = Language
- O = Organisation

Instructions:
- Give marks from 1 to 7 for each category
- Include marks from two markers: 1st marker and 2nd marker
- Base your scoring realistically on the student's writing
- Justify the scores briefly in 2–3 sentences below

Format the score table like this:
   C   L   O
1st marker 6 7 7
2nd marker 5 6 6

Show the banding of the student after summing up the score above like this:
score around 38 = level 5**
score around 34 = level 5*
score around 30 = level 5

Show comments for each criteria as well
