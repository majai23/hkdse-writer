Task:
Write a ${type} on the topic: "${topic}" in the style of a Level ${level} candidate.

Important:
- The structure and tone must match the ${type} format exactly.
- Use features typical of that genre — do not mix with others.
- Do NOT begin with greetings unless appropriate.
- The writing must be between ${wordLimit} words (excluding punctuation). If you exceed the limit, truncate at the last full sentence. Do NOT write fewer than the lower limit.
